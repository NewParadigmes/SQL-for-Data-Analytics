:: DATE: converts to a date format by removing the time portion
:: -> used for casting, which means converting a value from one data type to another

example: 

SELECT 
    job_title_short as Title,
    job_location as location, 
    job_posted_date :: Date as Date,
    extract(month from job_posted_date) as date_month
from 
    job_postings_fact
LIMIT 5;

AL TIME ZONE: Converts a timestamp to a specific time zone

Exmaple: changing from UTC to EST
SELECT 
    job_title_short as Title,
    job_location as location, 
    job_posted_date at time zone 'UTC' at time zone 'EST' as Date,

from 
    job_postings_fact
LIMIT 5;

EXTRACT: Gets specific date parts (e.g. year, month, day)

Exmaple: 

SELECT 
    job_title_short as Title,
    job_location as location, 
    job_posted_date at time zone 'UTC' at time zone 'EST' as Date,
    extract(month from job_posted_date) as date_month
from 
    job_postings_fact
LIMIT 5;
