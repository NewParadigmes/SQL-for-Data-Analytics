A CASE expression in SQL is the way to apply conditional logic within SQL queries 

CASE - begins the expression, 
WHEN - specifies the condition to look at, 
THEN - what to do when the condition is TRUE
ELSE (optional) - provides the output if none of the WHEN are met
END - concludes the CASE expression 

Example: 
/* create a new column where 
- 'Anywhere' jobs are remote
- 'New York, NY' jobs as 'Local'
- otherwise 'onsite'
*/

SELECT 
count(job_id) as number_of_jobs,
Case 
    when job_location = 'Anywhere' then 'Remote'
    when job_location = 'New York, NY' then 'Local'
    else 'Onsite'
end as location_category
    from job_postings_fact
    where job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    GROUP BY
    location_category;
